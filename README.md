**Credit Card Fraud Detection**
This project involves building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model is trained on a dataset that includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions, with the goal of accurately identifying fraudulent activity.

**Project Overview**
Credit card fraud is a significant issue for financial institutions and customers. This project aims to develop a model that can help in detecting such fraudulent activities effectively, reducing the financial losses associated with fraud.

**Features**

**1. Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training.

**2. Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that improve the model's performance.

**3. Model Training:** Implementing and training various machine learning models.

**4. Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**5. Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the model for better performance.

**Prerequisites:**
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains anonymized credit card transactions. It includes features such as transaction amount, transaction time, and others that have been anonymized for privacy reasons.

**Model Performance**
The model's performance is measured using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are visualized using confusion matrices and ROC curves to better understand the model's effectiveness.
