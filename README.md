#Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project involves analyzing credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activities using various data analysis and machine learning techniques.

##Project Overview
The dataset used in this project contains 284,807 transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent ones. The aim is to explore the data, visualize trends, and build a model to predict fraudulent transactions.

##Setup and Installation

###Import Libraries:
The following libraries are used in the project:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
xgboost
scikit-learn

###Data Exploration:
Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure.
Display basic statistics and visualize the distribution of the transaction amounts.
Analyze the class distribution (normal vs. fraudulent transactions).

###Data Visualization:
Visualize the distribution of transaction amounts and compare legitimate vs. fraudulent transactions.
Use scatter plots, pie charts, and bar charts to explore the data.

###Model Building:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and RandomForestClassifier.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

###Results:
The models are evaluated to detect fraudulent transactions effectively, with results visualized and summarized.
